Why are people so attracted to country music? I have heard a few reasons over the years. One reason is that the lyrics in country songs are about real life. They deal with the topics of lost love, true love, family, and having fun. Who wouldn’t relate to these? With pressures of school, family, and work, most people are looking for a release. Country music seems to encourage us to let our hair down, forget all about our problems and have a good time even if it’s just for a few moments.
