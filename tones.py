Being an enthusiastic hip-hop dancer myself, I really wanted to find out some more about this.\n\nFormal tone: This extended essay on how the lyrics of hip-hop developed as a form of protest against a society segregating the working classes is based on the premise of the music having a distinct and energizing rhythm that really inspires people to move, thereby reaching out to audiences who wouldn’t normally believe in protest, let alone speak out in public. Thus, the music becomes a vehicle for words of protest that can and indeed have changed the world. My own experience with dancing hip-hop at a relatively advanced and skilled level fuelled my desire to research this topic in more depth.\n--\nInformal tone: Biology has always been a passion of mine. Ever since I was searching for frogspawn in my grandparent’s pond as a four-year-old and annoying my mum with a battery of jam jars on the window sill in which I was trying to raise tadpoles I have been fascinated with observing nature in detail. Even in English, reading Death of a Naturalist by Seamus Heaney, I found myself thinking up an experiment to do with dragonflies and bluebottles. I have a fish tank at home with three different sorts of fish. I’ve noticed that they all respond differently when I feed them. I’m wondering what else is different in their behavior so, in this extended essay, I’m going to find out how they react to light.\n\nFormal tone: This extended essay is focused on investigating the phototaxic responses of three different species of fish that occupy different areas of an aquarium: danios (Danio rerio), which group near the surface of the water, black skirt tetra (Gymnocorymbus ternetzi), which swim in the middle of the tank, and kuhli loach (Pangio kuhlii), which swim near the bottom of the tank. It is anticipated that they will respond differently to light according to their niche within the tank. The outcome of my investigation could inform the feeding strategy used for different fish as well as highlight the adaptive nature of toxic response in fish. In addition, this essay may help to inspire some fellow students to view their fish with new interest, and consider their own strategies in populating a fish tank.\n--\nInformal tone: When I go into a supermarket there is always gentle background music playing, although in the clothes shops I like it is always loud pop music. At breakfast my dad likes to listen to Rossini string sonatas, while my little brother has heavy metal on his iPod and will head-bang his way through a bowl of cornflakes. My extended essay is trying to research why people rely on certain types of music to influence their mood and how music is used in this way for advertising. I am not sure if there is a connection and whether the music does affect, for example, people’s shopping habits, but it will be interesting to try to find out, especially to see if different peoples’ brains are wired differently when it comes to music.\n\nFormal tone: This extended essay intends to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between music listened to and the mood of individuals. Additionally, it will seek to explore whether this relationship is used in advertising to encourage people to spend money.\n--\nInformal tone: The improvements canʼt be introduced due to funding restrictions.\n\nFormal tone: Improvements cannot be introduced due to funding restrictions.\n--\nInformal tone: During the interview, I asked students about their experiences.\n\nFormal tone: During the interview, students were asked about their experiences.\n--\nInformal tone: If you’re not sure where the future is headed for us, then you’re not alone, experts in fields ranging from technology to the environment offer a million different predictions as to what the future has in store for us. Some predict warfare and social collapse, but others say we’ll all thrive and prosper. Whatever’s going on, I think our world is rapidly changing from the world our ancestors knew; the future is totally going to be a different place.\n\nFormal tone: Given the profound effect that innovations have had on the environment and consequently on the conditions of human life, it is reasonable to be concerned about what the future holds. As a consequence of the relentless pace of change, it is difficult to form any meaningful public policy to respond unless these issues are intelligently and carefully considered. However, given the complexity of the issues to address, it cannot be assumed that the world will remain static.\n--\nInformal tone: In a hundred years, the world might be very different than it is today. Even in the last twenty years, the technology that most of us use at this point has changed drastically, but now this rate of change is getting faster and faster. If the change that is currently happening keeps its current speed, then what our world is like in the next 100 years is a challenge to even imagine.\n\nFormal tone: Humans have tried to predict the future for as far back as history shows, and the only thing that has changed about this practice is the methods we use to make these predictions. Experts in fields ranging from technology to environmental science simultaneously offer predictions of warfare and social collapse with predictions of peace and prosperity. Regardless of these forecasts, the world is rapidly changing from the one our ancestors knew, hurtling us into a future that is increasingly difficult to imagine.\n--\nInformal tone: Formal writing feels harder than informal writing. I think it’s because I can’t use contractions or short sentences. The only reason I’d write informally is if I had to, like if it was professional or academic. But when I write like this about formal writing, it’s easier. My vocabulary doesn’t matter as much. As you can see, I still care about grammar. Writing like this feels like I am talking to a friend.\n\nFormal tone: When writing academically or professionally, it is important to show respect to your audience by electing to write in a formal style, rather than informally. This means that sentences are longer than usual and tend to feel complex. Writing complex sentences with hyperfluent vocabulary shows your audience that you are well-informed on the subject matter. Furthermore, this writing style depicts unbiased information eluding emotions and first-person pronouns from the content.\n--\nInformal tone: I have a family tradition every year on July 4th. We all know that July 4th is the Independence day. Many celebrate this holiday differently. Me and my mother reach out to our close ones in the family, this is because we do not often see our family every year. So we figured July 4th is the special day every year to bring the loved ones and family together. I see my family quite often, our get togetherness are very entertaining. I believe family matters, the way I show others in my life that they actually matter to me is a big blessing.\n\nFormal tone: My family has a tradition of celebrating the Fourth of July every year. It is a day when we get together with our close family members. We enjoy each other’s company and the day is a great opportunity to catch up and talk about the things that we have all missed. Though we see each other frequently, it is a day when we get to spend together with our family and friends.\n--\nInformal tone:' + string + '\n' + '\Formal tone:',

#print(informal_to_formal("Why are people so attracted to country music? I have heard a few reasons over the years. One reason is that the lyrics in country songs are about real life. They deal with the topics of lost love, true love, family, and having fun. Who wouldn’t relate to these? With pressures of school, family, and work, most people are looking for a release. Country music seems to encourage us to let our hair down, forget all about our problems and have a good time even if it’s just for a few moments."))
